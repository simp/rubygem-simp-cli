# GENERAL INFORMATION
This is a bit complicated...The YAML files in this directory are used to
generate YAML strings that describe the decision trees appropriate for
configuring particular SIMP scenarios.  Specifically, each scenario_items.yaml
specifies a sequence of YAML fragments that, when combined, creates the
scenario's configuration decision tree YAML.  Each fragment (aka part) is
comprised of a sequence of Items, where

- each Item is a data Item or an action Item
- a data Item is used to ascertain a value, which, in turn can be used
  as branch point in the decision tree
- an action Items simply affects an action
- any Item can use the value(s) from one or more data Items that precede it
  in the tree.

# SCENARIO ITEMS YAML FORMAT
The scenario files are used to generate the YAML decision trees.  These
files must be named scenario_items.yaml and must contain 3 keys:

- name: name of the scenario
- description: description of the scenario
- includes: sequence of YAML fragments (parts) that will be concatenated
  to create the scenario's configuration, decision tree YAML.

Any element in the 'includes' sequence can itself have 0 or more
variable substitutions defined.  See simp_item.yaml and parts/ldap_setup
for an example of variable substitutions.

NOTE:

- Each part in the 'includes' must exist in the 'parts' sub-directory.
- Since many configuration Items have dependencies upon other Items, the
  parts must be listed in a fashion that satisfies these dependencies.
  Otherwise and Simp::Cli::Config::InternalError will be raised.
- Fragments are intended to provide a form of code reuse. So, apply
  the DRY principle, when you are creating/reworking scenarios.

# GENERATED YAML FILE FORMAT
This section describes the format of the generated, decision tree,
which necessarily also describes the format of the YAML fragments.

The format is:
```yaml
---
- ItemA
- ItemB:
  answer1:
  - ItemC modifier1
  - ItemD
  answer2:
  - ItemE
  - ItemF modifier2 modifier3:
     answer3:
     - ItemG
- ItemH
```

where modifiers, which are parsed as part of the YAML key, are
used to control specific behaviors of an Item.  The supported
modifiers are as follows:

- FILE=value   = set the Item's .file to value
- DRYRUNAPPLY  = make sure this Item's apply() is called when the
  :dry_run option is selected; (Normally an Item's
  .skip_apply is set to prevent the apply() from running
  when :dry_run is selected.)
- NOAPPLY      = set the Item's .skip_apply ; Item.apply() will do nothing
- USERAPPLY    = execute Item's apply() even when running non-privileged
- SILENT       = set the Item's .silent ; suppresses stdout console/log output;
  This option is best used in conjuction with SKIPQUERY for
  Items for which no user interaction is required (i.e.,
  Items for which internal logic can be used to figure
  out their correct values).
- SKIPQUERY    = set the Item's .skip_query ; Item will use default_value
- NOYAML       = set the Item's .skip_yaml ; no YAML for Item will be written
- GENERATENOQUERY = set the PasswordItem's .generate_option to :generate_no_query
- NEVERGENERATE   = set the PasswordItem's .generate_option to :never_generate

For this example, if the answer to ItemB was 'answer1' the sequence of
configuration queries/actions would be:

1. ItemA
2. ItemB
3. ItemC
4. ItemD
5. ItemH

## NOTES

1. The CliSimpScenario data Item can be assumed to always be pre-set (i.e. no
   query required).
2. Other data Item values will be pre-set, if they exist in the hieradata YAML
   file corresponding to the scenario, or are passed into 'simp config' by
   file or command-line arguments.  For example, simp::options::ldap is
   present in the simp' and the 'simp_lite' scenarios hieradata files, and thus
   will be pre-set here.
3. Remember Item order matters, as Items have access to values from data Items
   earlier in the tree and use those values in their logic.
   For example, several Items require cli::network::hostname, which is
   set by CliNetworkHostname.
4. Action Items do not ask the user for any input, but simply affect an action.
5. Since modifiers are parsed as part of a YAML key, they must appear before the ':'.
   (This looks weird, but the parser knows what to do with it.)
