#{'#'*72}
Per security policy, SIMP, by default, disables login via `ssh` for all users,
including `root`, and beginning with SIMP 6.0.0, disables `root` logins at
the console by default.  So, if one of the following scenarios applies, you
should configure a local user for this server to have both `su` and `ssh`
privileges, in order to prevent `root` lockout from the system:

* Console access is available but not allowed for `root` and no other
  administrative user account has yet been created.

  * This can happen when SIMP is installed from RPM and the user accepts
    `simp config`'s default value for `useradd:securetty` (an empty array).

* Both console access is not available and the administrative user's `ssh`
  access has not yet been enabled (permanently) via Puppet.

  * This can happen when SIMP is installed from RPM on cloud systems.

If you have access to the console, have the `root` password, and have enabled
`root` console access by specifying an appropriate TTY when `simp config`
asked you about `useradd::securetty` (e.g., `tty0`), this warning is not
applicable.  If there are no other issues identified in this file, you can
simply remove it and run `simp bootstrap`.

Otherwise, to address the potential `root` lockout issue, follow the
instructions below.

Configure Local User for Access
-------------------------------

In these instructions, you will create a manifest in a local module, `mymodule`,
in the `production` Puppet environment.  Execute these operations as `root`.

 * See https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/modules.html for information on how
   to create a Puppet module.

1. Create a local user account, as needed, using `useradd`.  This example
   assumes the local user is `userx`.

   * Be sure to set the user's password if the user is logging in with a password.
   * SIMP is configured to create a home directory for the user, if it does
     not exist when the user first logs in.

2. Create a `local_user.pp` manifest in `mymodule/manifests` to enable
   `sudo su - root` and allow `ssh` access for the user you created/selected:

   a) Create the manifest directory

        $ mkdir -p /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/modules/mymodule/manifests

   b) Create `/etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/modules/mymodule/manifests/local_user.pp`
      with the following content:

        class mymodule::local_user (
          Boolean $pam = simplib::lookup('simp_options::pam', { 'default_value' => false }),
        ) {

          sudo::user_specification { 'default_userx':
            user_list => ['userx'],
            runas     => 'root',
        #    passwd    => false,   # only needed if user logs in without a password
            cmnd      => ['/bin/su root', '/bin/su - root']
          }

         if $pam {
           include 'pam'

           pam::access::rule { 'allow_userx':
             users   => ['userx'],
             origins => ['ALL'],
             comment => 'The local user, used to remotely login to the system in the case of a lockout.'
           }
         }
       }

   c) Uncomment out the `passwd` line in `sudo::user_specification` if the local
      user is configured to login with pre-shared keys instead of a password
     (typical cloud configuration).

3. Create a `metadata.json` file for the module at
   `/etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/modules/mymodule`.

   * See //puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/modules_metadata.html#metadatajson-example
     for more information on metadata.json files.
   * It should look something like the following:

     {
       "name": "mymodule",
       "version": "0.0.1",
       "author": "Your name or group here",
       "summary": "Configures Local User for sudo access",
       "license": "Apache-2.0",
       "source": "Your gitlab url or local",
       "dependencies": [
         {
           "name": "simp/pam"
         },
         {
           "name": "simp/simplib"
         },
         {
           "name": "simp/sudo"
         }
       ]
     }

4. Make sure the permissions are correct on the module:

     $ sudo chown -R root:puppet /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/modules/mymodule
     $ sudo chmod -R g+rX /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/modules/mymodule

5. Add the module to the SIMP server's host YAML file class list:

   Edit the SIMP server's YAML file,
   `/etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/data/hosts/<SIMP server FQDN>.yaml`
   and add the `mymodule::local_user` to the `simp::classes` array:

     simp::classes:
       - mymodule::local_user

5. If the local user is configured to login with pre-shared keys instead of a
   password (typical cloud configuration), copy the `authorized_keys` file for
   that user to the SIMP-managed location for authorized keys `/etc/ssh/local_keys`:

     $ sudo mkdir -p /etc/ssh/local_keys
     $ sudo chmod 755 /etc/ssh/local_keys
     $ sudo cp ~userx/.ssh/authorized_keys /etc/ssh/local_keys/userx
     $ sudo chmod 644 /etc/ssh/local_keys/userx

6. Add the module to the `Puppetfile` in the `production` environment:

   Edit the `Puppetfile` used to deploy the modules,
   `/etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/Puppetfile`,  and add a line
   under the section that says "Add your own Puppet modules here"

     mod 'mymodule', :local => true

Next Steps
----------

1.  If `root` lockout is the only issue identified in this file, remove the file
    and continue with `simp bootstrap`.  If not, address any remaining issues,
    remove the file, and then run `simp bootstrap`.

2.  ***IMPORTANT***.  After `simp bootstrap` but BEFORE you reboot the server,
    do the following:

    a) Run `puppet agent -t` to verify that there are no warning or error
       messages related to `mymodule`.

       * You will see a reboot notification which is expected and not an issue.
       * You may see warning/errors related to other modules that manage
         services you have not completely set up, such as `named`. These are
         expected.

    b) Verify that you can ssh into the server as the new user. If you cannot,
       do not reboot the server until you resolve the problem! This step is 
       imperative to ensure that you can also get through Puppet-managed 
       authentication.
