'enforcing' = Shut down and disable all services not listed in your
              manifests or the exclusion file
'warning'   = Only report what undeclared services should be shut
              down and disabled, without actually making the changes
              to the system

NOTICE: svckill is the mechanism that SIMP uses to comply with the
requirement that no unauthorized services are running on your system.
If you are fully aware of all services that need to be running on the
system, including any custom applications, use 'enforcing'.  If you
first need to ascertain which services should be running on the system,
use 'warning'.}

%Q{IMPORTANT:  Be sure to register your site-specific services with
svckill to prevent them from being automatically shut down and disabled.
See svckill::ignore and svckill::ignore_files.},

        :warning =>
%Q{IMPORTANT: Once you have examined the list of undeclared services
reported by svckill and have determined which of those should be
allowed, register the allowed services with svckill and then change
#{@key} to 'enforcing'.  See svckill::ignore and svckill::ignore_files.}
