an ISO install.

Per security policy, SIMP, by default, disables login via ssh for all
users, including 'root', and beginning with SIMP 6.0.0 disables, root
logins at the console.  So, to prevent lockout in systems for which
no administrative user account has yet been created or both console
access is not available and the administrative user's ssh access
has not yet been enabled, the SIMP ISO installation creates a
local user, 'simp', for which su and ssh privileges will be enabled
via the simp::server manifest, when SIMP is bootstrapped.}
