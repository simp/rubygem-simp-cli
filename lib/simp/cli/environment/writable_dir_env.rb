    # Fix consistency of Puppet directory environment
    #
    # @note This method is intentionally inert, as there has been some concern
    #   about whether this action is appropriate to implement for Writable
    #   environment directories.
    #
    #   The Puppet server originates the files found in this environment, and we
    #   shouldn't need to 'fix' them unless something has gone very wrong
    #   indeed.  Additionally, the potential for mayhem increases if we monkey
    #   with the permissions of Puppet server's internal files.
    #
    #
    #   Current conclusion:
    #
    #   If the :copy logic of #create is implemented in a way that also copies
    #   files' permissions and attributes, a Writable env dir should never need
    #   user-initiated #fix actions.
    #
    #
    #   Exception:
    #
    #   If `simp environment import` is implemented as planned, ia #fix action
    #   may become useful to fix permissions when migrating SIMP Omni
    #   environments between different Puppet/PE servers.
