# You can use these answers to quickly configure subsequent
# simp installations by running the command:
#
#   simp config -A /PATH/TO/THIS/FILE
#
# simp config will prompt for any missing items.
#
# NOTE:
# - All YAML keys that begin with 'cli::' are used by
#   simp config, internally, and are not Puppet hieradata.
#
# - Any entry with the following comment is automatically,
#   silently set by `simp config`.
#
#     >> VALUE SET BY `simp config` AUTOMATICALLY. <<
#
#   This means if you modify any of these entries in
#   an answers file, and then feed that file back into
#   `simp config`, your modifications will be lost!

# === cli::version ===
# The version of simp-cli used to generate this file.
# >> VALUE SET BY `simp config` AUTOMATICALLY. <<
cli::version: "0.0.0"

# === cli::network::hostname ===
# The Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) of the system.
#
# This *MUST* contain a domain. Simple hostnames are not allowed.
cli::network::hostname: myhost.test.local

# === cli::simp::scenario ===
# The SIMP scenario: Predetermined set of security features to apply.
#
# 'simp'      = Settings for a full SIMP system. Both the SIMP server
#               (this host) and all clients will be running with
#               all security features enabled.
# 'simp_lite' = Settings for a SIMP system in which some security features
#               are disabled for SIMP clients.  The SIMP server will
#               be running with all security features enabled.
# 'poss'      = Settings for a SIMP system in which all security features
#               for the SIMP clients are disabled.  The SIMP server will
#               be running with all security features enabled.
#
# NOTE:  If your site has different needs than provided by the predetermined
# scenarios, you can always fine-tune the security settings after you have
# bootstrapped your SIMP server.
cli::simp::scenario: simp_lite

# === simp::runlevel ===
# The default system runlevel (1-5).
simp::runlevel: 2

# === simp_options::fips ===
# Prepare system to use FIPS mode.
#
# simp_options::fips enforces strict compliance with FIPS-140-2.  All core SIMP
# modules can support this configuration. Enabling simp_options::fips will
# enable FIPS on this puppet environment.
#
# IMPORTANT:
# (1) Be sure you know the security tradeoffs of FIPS-140-2 compliance.
#     FIPS mode disables the use of MD5, but may require weaker ciphers or key
#     lengths than your security policies allow.
# (2) If the system is currently in FIPS mode and you set this option to false,
#     the system will still work.  ***The reverse is not necessarily true.***
#     See SIMP documentation for manual instructions on how to safely convert
#     a non-FIPS system to a FIPS system.
# (3) When set from `simp config`, this value is the actual system setting
#     at the time `simp config` was run, and cannot be overriden by any
#     command line/answers file input to `simp config`. This behavior is to
#     protect the user from unintended system corruption described in (2).
#
simp_options::fips: false

# === simp_options::puppet::server ===
# The Hostname or FQDN of the Puppet server.
simp_options::puppet::server: puppet.domain.tld
