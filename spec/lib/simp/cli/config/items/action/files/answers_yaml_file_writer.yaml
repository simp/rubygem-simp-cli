# === cli::network::hostname ===
# The FQDN of the system.
cli::network::hostname: myhost.test.local

# === cli::simp::scenario ===
# The SIMP scenario.
#
# 'simp'      = Settings for a full SIMP system. Both the SIMP server
#               (this host) and all clients will be running with
#               all security features enabled.
# 'simp_lite' = Settings for a SIMP system in which some security features
#               are disabled for SIMP clients.  The SIMP server will
#               be running with all security features enabled.
# 'poss'      = Settings for a SIMP system in which all security features
#               for the SIMP clients are disabled.  The SIMP server will
#               be running with all security features enabled.
#
cli::simp::scenario: simp_lite

# === simp::runlevel ===
# The default system runlevel (1-5).
simp::runlevel: 2

# === simp_options::fips ===
# Prepare system to use FIPS mode.
#
# simp_options::fips enforces strict compliance with FIPS-140-2.  All core SIMP modules
# can support this configuration. Enabling simp_options::fips here will enable
# FIPS on this puppet environment.
#
# IMPORTANT:
# (1) Be sure you know the security tradeoffs of FIPS-140-2 compliance.
#     FIPS mode disables the use of MD5 and may require weaker ciphers or key
#     lengths than your security policies allow.
# (2) If the system is currently in FIPS mode and you set this option to false,
#     the system will still work.  The reverse is not necessarily true.  See
#     SIMP documentation for instructions on how to safely convert a non-FIPS
#     system to a FIPS system.
#
simp_options::fips: false

# === simp_options::puppet::server ===
# The Hostname or FQDN of the Puppet server.
simp_options::puppet::server: puppet.domain.tld
