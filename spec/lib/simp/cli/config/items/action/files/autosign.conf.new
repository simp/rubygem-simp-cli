# You should place any hostnames/domains here that you wish to autosign.
# The most security concious method is to list each individual hostname:
#    hosta.your.domain
#    hostb.your.domain
#
# Wildcard domains work, but absolutely should NOT be used unless you fully
# trust your network.
#    *.your.domain
#
puppet.your.domain
