# === simp::runlevel ===
# The default system runlevel (1-5).
simp::runlevel: 2

# === simp_options::fips ===
# Prepare system to use FIPS mode.
#
# simp_options::fips enforces strict compliance with FIPS-140-2.  All core SIMP
# modules can support this configuration. Enabling simp_options::fips will
# enable FIPS on this puppet environment.
#
# IMPORTANT:
# (1) Be sure you know the security tradeoffs of FIPS-140-2 compliance.
#     FIPS mode disables the use of MD5, but may require weaker ciphers or key
#     lengths than your security policies allow.
# (2) If the system is currently in FIPS mode and you set this option to false,
#     the system will still work.  ***The reverse is not necessarily true.***
#     See SIMP documentation for manual instructions on how to safely convert
#     a non-FIPS system to a FIPS system.
# (3) When set from `simp config`, this value is the actual system setting
#     at the time `simp config` was run, and cannot be overriden by any
#     command line/answers file input to `simp config`. This behavior is to
#     protect the user from unintended system corruption described in (2).
